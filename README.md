As a developer, I've always used TFS to handle version control.  Until now.

I just got a new job for an Indy based consulting firm and I'm trying to get the hang of it all.  In addition to using Git for the first time, I'm also taking a Plurlasight course on Angular2.  To tackle both, my plan is to create branches for each module and commit them back to the Master branch just like I would at work.

This is not my code, the original repository is from Deborah Kurata.  Check out the repository for the course here:

"https://github.com/DeborahK/Angular2-GettingStarted".

You'll notice this isn't exactly like the original "APM - Start" directory in her repository.  I decided to practice Git halfway through her tutorial.
